516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence
Medium  https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

Example 2:
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists only of lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def longestPalindromeSubseq(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        if n < 2:
            return n
        dp = [[0 for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = 1
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if s[i] == s[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])
        return dp[0][n-1]
